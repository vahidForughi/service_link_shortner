     *  Important Note From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes :
     *
     *  For a PUT request: HTTP 200, HTTP 204 should imply "resource updated successfully".
     *  HTTP 201 if the PUT request created a new resource.
     *  For a DELETE request: HTTP 200 or HTTP 204 should imply "resource deleted successfully".
     *  HTTP 202 can also be returned by either operation and would imply that the instruction was accepted by the server,
     *  but not fully applied yet. It's possible that the operation fails later,
     *  so the client shouldn't fully assume that it was success.
     *  A client that receives a status code it doesn't recognize, but it's starting with 2 should treat it as a 200 OK.
     *
     *  PUT
     *  If an existing resource is modified,
     *  either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request.
     *
     *  DELETE
     *  A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes an entity describing the status,
     *  202 (Accepted) if the action has not yet been enacted,
     *  or 204 (No Content) if the action has been enacted but the response does not include an entity.
